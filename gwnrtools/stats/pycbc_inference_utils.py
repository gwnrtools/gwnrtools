        Usage Notes
        -----------

        [1] Compatible with `ConfigWriter`.
        This class is easiest used with the writer it returns.

        [2] Arguments for `sampler.ini` and `inference.ini`
            are formatted in the initialization of this class

        Therefore, when configuring for Injections
        ------------------------------------------
        No special notes

        [3] Arguments for `data.ini` are not formatted in this class,
        but can be when writing it through its ConfigWriter.

        Therefore, when configuring for Events
        --------------------------------------
        Need the following named variables to be provided to the
        ConfigWriter's `write` function:

        gpstime       : int
        H1_frame_file : str
        H1_channel    : str
        L1_frame_file : str
        L1_channel    : str
        V1_frame_file : str
        V1_channel    : str
        sample_rate   : int (power of 2)
